Artificer subclass for Foundry VTT, compatible with Steinhardt's Guide to the Eldritch Hunt. Credit and ownership goes to MonkeyDM.

- You will need to previously have the <a href="https://monkeydm.shop/products/steinhardts-guide-vtt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinhardt's Foundry VTT Module</a> for this to properly work because of Steinhardt's spells (didn't added them for copyright reasons).

- To install the module paste the manifest <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marioo217/artificer-mortis-engineer/main/module.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">URL</a> into your Foundry server's module installer.
  
- To add this subclass to your character, go to your Compendiums > Artificer - Mortis Engineer > and just drag Mortis Engineer to your sheet.

- Your reanimated zombies and flesh titan are not in the pack. Normal zombies and Flesh Golem are linked in their respective abilities (Galvanized Flesh and Flesh Titan).
  Drag the linked Zombie or Flesh Golem to your Actors tab.
  Then you just have to edit in the extra life, damage, speed and everything else necessary (probably there's a way to make it automatic but I didn't know how to do it sorry).

- I added Witch Bolt, it isn't by default at foundry for some reason. Also Negative Energy Flood, as that spell is from Xanathar's Guide.

- When you reach lv. 5 don't forget to add System Overload to your zombies!

- Corpse Bag added.

I'm not the owner of this subclass, that is MonkeyDM. I just made a port to Foundry VTT.<br/>

Check it out! He's got some other cool things there.<br/>
I also recommend buying his book, <a href="https://monkeydm.shop/collections/steinhardts-guide-to-the-eldritch-hunt-all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steinhardtâ€™s Guide to the Eldritch Hunt</a>, the one that this artificer subclass is compatible with.<br/><br/>

I will try to keep this module updated.
